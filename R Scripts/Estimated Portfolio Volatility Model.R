# Estimated Portfolio Volatility Model

# I WILL BE USING ETFs AND MFs SO THEY WILL LIKELY NOT HAVE A LONG ENOUGH HISTORY (NEED TO PROBABLY ONLY GENERATE 1 YR FORECAST)

# Portfolio Variance - Weights of portfolio holdings x covariance matrix x expected returns

#Look at portfolio variance in a number of ways:
  #Based upon only historical returns (MVO methodology or Portfolio Resampling Methodology)
  #Based upon modeled estimates
    # autoregressive methods for modeling the covariance matrix (VAR or GARCH)
    # portfolio drift for future returns? (what effect will that have from the obversers bias?)
    # 

# I will be Using ETFs and Mutual Funds (They may not have longer term returns)

# If I use benchmarks, I will have a much larger dataset, but it will not be well representative of the portfolio
